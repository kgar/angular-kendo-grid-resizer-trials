# To Do
- Set up display: none content, both with stylesheet and with inline styles. Ensure the service does not accumulate occupied height for content that does not take up vertical space.
- Set up float div and teach height service to ignore it
- Set up 5 single-letter spans and 1 2-line span all side-by-side, and update the height service to account for this
