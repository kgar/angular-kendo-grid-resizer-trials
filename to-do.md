# To Do
- Add window resize to the test harness and vet that it resizes
- Throttle the resize handler to 15fps
- Add padding / margin to the harness for thing-to-resize
- Retest with various parameters
- Set up Kendo grid dependencies
- Replace the div thing-to-resize with a grid
- Vet that the grid can be resized with a button click
- Extract the resize code into the service RemainingHeightCalculator
- Create a directive to attach to the grid called autoResizeKendoGrid
- Inject RemainingHeightCalculator into the directive
- Add a public resize() function to the directive that uses the service to get the proposed height and resize
- Only allow resize() to work once ngAfterViewInit has fired
- Expose a setting for hooking resize() into the window's resize event at 15fps
