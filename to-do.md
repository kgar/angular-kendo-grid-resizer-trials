# To Do
- Add a public resize() function to the directive that uses the service to get the proposed height and resize
- Add Height input and Set Height button to arbitrarily change grid height
- Only allow resize() to work once ngAfterViewInit has fired
- Provide an options object parameter for the directive
  - debounceDuration?: number = 300
  - resizeWithWindow?: boolean = true
  - resizeAfterInit?: boolean = true
- Test and verify that HostListener is not going to keep re-subscribing each time the 
- Does the height calculator account for content being display: none?
- Does the height calculator account for display: inline elements? What about sibling display: inline elements?
  - What is the established HTML behavior here?
- Does the height calculator account for floating elements?
  - I think I should be ignoring floating elements unless they are the height of the parent container. Verify.
