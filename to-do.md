# To Do
- Add padding / margin to the harness for thing-to-resize
- Retest with various parameters and make corrections to resize algorithm
- Extract the resize code into the service RemainingHeightCalculator
- Create a directive to attach to the grid called autoResizeKendoGrid
- Inject RemainingHeightCalculator into the directive
- Add a public resize() function to the directive that uses the service to get the proposed height and resize
- Only allow resize() to work once ngAfterViewInit has fired
- Provide an options object parameter for the directive
  - debounceDuration?: number = 300
  - resizeWithWindow?: boolean = true
